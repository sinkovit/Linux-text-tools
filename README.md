# Linux-text-tools

This repository accompanies the *Linux tools for text processing* talk
that is offered by SDSC and delivered through XSEDE, SDSC's HPC
training series and other venues. It currently contains examples
illustrating the use of awk, grep, head, paste, sed, sort, shuf, split and
tail, along with several more realistic case studies that combine
multiple tools.

The purpose of this material is ***not*** to make anyone an expert in
the use of any of the specific tools. Entire books have been written
on awk and sed! Rather, the goal is to provide a brief overview of
this collection of common Linux tools so that one can quickly get up
to speed automating tediuous and error prone text manipulations.

The case studies were developed for users working in a scientific
computing environment, but should be useful to anyone looking for a
gentle introduction.
